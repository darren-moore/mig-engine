# mig-engine
A WIP C++/OpenGL 2D game engine.
* Entity-component model for GameObjects and a service locator to access sub-engines.
* Uses [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) for window creation, [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/) for matrix math, [Glad](https://glad.dav1d.de/) for OpenGL loading, and [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h
) for image loading.
